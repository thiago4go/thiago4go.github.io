# Kubernetes Threat Model

This section focuses on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks unique to Kubernetes environments. Learn how attackers exploit clusters and apply proactive strategies to defend against persistence, privilege escalation, data breaches, and more.

#### **What You’ll Learn**

A systematic approach to securing Kubernetes against real-world threats, covering:

* **Attack Surface Mapping**: Define trust boundaries and visualize data flows between components, users, and external systems to pinpoint vulnerabilities.
* **Persistence & Lateral Movement**: Detect backdoors hidden in DaemonSets, CronJobs, or compromised etcd instances, and block lateral movement tactics.
* **Runtime Threats**: Identify rogue containers executing cryptojacking, reverse shells, or fileless attacks using tools like Falco and Tracee.
* **Network Exploits**: Prevent man-in-the-middle and sniffing attacks by enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) and encrypting pod-to-pod traffic.
* **Data Exposure Risks**: Secure secrets from leaks via environment variables, logs, or memory dumps, and encrypt sensitive runtime data.
* **Privilege Escalation**: Mitigate container breakouts by restricting host access, Linux capabilities, and root user execution.
* **Resource Attacks**: Block denial-of-service (DoS) threats with resource quotas, priority classes, and workload limits.
* **Structured Threat Modeling**: Apply the STRIDE framework to systematically assess spoofing, tampering, and escalation risks in your cluster.

#### **Why It Matters**

Kubernetes clusters are high-value targets for attackers due to their complexity and access to critical workloads. Unmitigated threats like unsecured data flows, excessive permissions, or runtime intrusions can lead to service disruption, data theft, or compliance violations. This series equips you to anticipate and neutralize these risks.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Start by mapping your cluster’s trust boundaries to understand its attack surface, then address specific threats like malicious workloads or network exploits. Posts like _Threat Modeling Kubernetes: STRIDE Methodology in Action_ provide frameworks to prioritize risks, while guides on runtime detection or mTLS offer ready-to-deploy configurations.
