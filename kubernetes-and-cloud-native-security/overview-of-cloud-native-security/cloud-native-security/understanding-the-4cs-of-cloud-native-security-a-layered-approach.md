# Understanding the 4Cs of Cloud Native Security: A Layered Approach

In the fast-moving world of cloud-native applications, robust security is like a well-planned Go board: each layer you place should reinforce your position and minimise vulnerabilities. With data breaches costing organisations millions of dollars, a layered, defence-in-depth approach is essential to maintain control over the board. This principle is embodied by the 4Cs of Cloud Native Security—Cloud, Cluster, Container, and Code—interconnected layers that combine to form a powerful defence.

**Let’s geek out for a moment**: just as in Go, an early misstake with your joseki can leave the rest of your territory vulnerable. By carefully securing each layer, you ensure the next move is always in your favour.

## **Historical Context: Defence-in-Depth Analogy**

Early security models relied on a single defensive perimeter – akin to medieval fortresses with one vulnerable wall. Modern "defence in depth" mirrors layered castle defenses (moats, inner walls, drawbridges), where breaches at one layer don’t guarantee total compromise. The 4Cs framework brings this philosophy to cloud-native environments, with each layer reinforcing the next.

## Modern Elements: The 4Cs of Cloud-Native Security

Each layer of cloud-native architecture introduces unique risks and demands tailored defenses. Below, we analyze the **Role**, **Common Risks**, **Best Practices**, and **Real-World Analysis** for each of the 4Cs—Cloud, Cluster, Container, and Code—to demonstrate how vulnerabilities cascade and how to mitigate them.

### Cloud: The Foundation of Trust

* **Role**: The infrastructure layer hosting your services.
* **Common Risks:** Misconfigurations (e.g., publicly exposed storage buckets), weak Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, and unpatched infrastructure services.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Apply the shared responsibility model diligently—cloud providers secure the infrastructure, but it is up to users to configure it securely.
  * Use Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools to automate compliance checks.&#x20;
  * Implement strong IAM policies to restrict and monitor access.
* **Real-World Analysis:**
  * [**Pegasus Airlines AWS Bucket Misconfiguration**](https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/iotw-turkish-based-airline-leaves-65-tb-of-sensitive-data-exposed)
    * **Incident**: A misconfigured AWS bucket exposed 6.5 terabytes of sensitive data, including flight charts, crew information, and navigation materials. This error led to significant data exposure.
    * **Key Challenges**:
      * Human error in configuring cloud storage settings.
      * Lack of automated compliance checks.
    * **Lessons Learned**:
      * Importance of educating employees on secure configurations.
      * Use of tools like Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) to detect misconfigurations proactively.
  * [**Toyota Cloud Misconfiguration**](https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/39241625.html)
    * **Incident**: Toyota exposed customer data due to a misconfigured cloud environment. The breach lasted from February 2015 to May 2023, affecting approximately 260,000 customers.
    * **Key Challenges**:
      * Prolonged exposure due to delayed detection.
      * Misconfiguration of cloud resources leading to external access.
    * **Lessons Learned**:
      * Regular audits and monitoring of cloud configurations are essential.
      * Even minor misconfigurations can have long-term consequences.

### Cluster: **Securing the Orchestrator**

* **Role**: Kubernetes clusters manage containerised workloads but are prime targets due to potential misconfigurations in role-based access control (RBAC) or exposed APIs.
* **Common Risks**: Unrestricted pod-to-pod communication, inadequate encryption of data in transit, and elevated permissions for cluster components.
* **Best Practices**:
  * Enforce RBAC and network segmentation (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies).
  * Leverage policy-as-code tools like Kyverno or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to validate and enforce configurations, blocking non-compliant deployments
  * Regularly patch and update Kubernetes components, especially the API server.
* **Real-World Analysis:**
  * [**Spotify Accidentally Deleted its Clusters**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix0Tw8uinWs)
    * **Incident: O**ne of the infrastructure engineers accidentally deleted one of the Kube clusters in Containers from their Cloud-Native Infrastructure, and again the other team deleted one more cluster in the USA
    * **Key Challenges:**
      * Human error during migration led to the deletion of a regional cluster mistaken for a test cluster.
      * Deployment scripts lacked robustness, requiring repeated attempts to restore the cluster.
      * A subsequent Terraform misconfiguration caused two additional clusters to be deleted.
    * **Lessons Learned**
      * Implement version control and peer review for deployment scripts to prevent accidental deletions
      * Make the experience of managing services deployed on Kubernetes easier for all developers - Launch [Backstage](https://backstage.io/)
  * [**Open Kubernetes Clusters Under Attack**](https://www.aquasec.com/news/kubernetes-clusters-under-attack/)
    * **Incident:** In 2023 Aqua Nautilus found clusters belonging to more than 350 organizations were openly accessible and unprotected. Clusters was connected to vast conglomerates and Fortune 500 companies.&#x20;
    * **Key Challenges:**
      * known and unknown misconfigurations, exposing them to attacks like cryptomining campaigns.
      * Common issues included anonymous access with privileges and exposed `kubectl` proxies.
    * **Lessons Learnd:**
      * Secure clusters by addressing known misconfigurations and implementing role-based access control (RBAC).
      * Monitor for malicious activity using honeypots or similar techniques.

### Container: **Minimizing Attack Surfaces**

* **Role**: Containers bundle your application code and dependencies but can contain hidden vulnerabilities if not regularly scanned, correctly configured and updated.
* **Common Risks**: Outdated libraries (e.g., the Log4j vulnerability), overly privileged container permissions, and unverified base images.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Use container-scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Snyk, or Clair) to detect vulnerabilities in images.
  * Employ minimal privileges—run containers with the least necessary permissions.
  * Automate signature validation in CI/CD pipelines to ensure only trusted images are used in production.
* **Real-World Analysis:**
  * [Log4Shell Vulnerability (Log4j)](https://www.criticalstart.com/log4j-the-aftermath-and-lessons-learned/)
    * **Incident:** The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) in the Log4j Java library allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, putting 72% of organizations globally at risk. This vulnerability impacted industries such as financial services, healthcare, software, and manufacturing.
    * **Key Challenges:**
      * The ubiquity of Log4j made it difficult to identify all instances of the vulnerability.
      * Organizations struggled to patch affected systems promptly due to the widespread use of the library in various applications.
      * Attackers used obfuscation techniques to evade detection and continued exploiting unpatched systems even years late
    * **Lessons Learned**
      * Collaboration with vendors and third parties is essential to ensure timely updates
      * Continuous monitoring and incident response capabilities are necessary to address emerging attack vectors. ([case-study](https://secureops.com/blog/log4j-a-case-study/))

### &#x20;Code: Securing the Application Core

* **Role**: Code is the innermost layer and the first line of defence. If your source code harbours security flaws or hardcoded secrets, attackers can use these to escalate privileges or move laterally.
* **Common Risks**: Hardcoded secrets in Git repositories, SQL injection vulnerabilities, unvalidated user inputs, and insecure dependencies from third-party libraries.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP).
  * Use Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all third-party dependencies and ensure timely updates.
  * Adopt DevSecOps practices—shift security checks left so issues are caught during development rather than post-deployment.
* **Real-World** **Analysis**:
  * [Solana JavaScript SDK Supply Chain Attack](https://www.cm-alliance.com/cybersecurity-blog/december-2024-major-cyber-attacks-data-breaches-ransomware-attacks)
    * **Incident:** The legitimate Solana Web3.js library was backdoored in a supply chain attack. Malicious code was injected to steal private cryptocurrency keys, enabling attackers to drain wallets.
    * **Key Challenges:**
      * Identifying and removing the backdoored library from the ecosystem.
      * Restoring trust in the compromised SDK.
      * Preventing further exploitation by malicious actors.
    * **Lessons Learned:**
      * Strengthen supply chain security with code-signing mechanisms.
      * Regularly verify the integrity of dependencies and libraries.
      * Educate developers on detecting suspicious changes in third-party tools

## 6 Actionable Recommendations

1. Automate Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scans
   * Tools like [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) or [Terrascan ](https://www.tenable.com/terrascan)can audit your Terraform files or Kubernetes manifests for misconfigurations.&#x20;
2. Enforce Zero-Trust Networking
   * Define [Kubernetes Network Policies ](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)to strictly limit communication channels between pods, preventing attackers from moving freely.
3. Adopt Shift-Left Security
   * Integrate scanning tools (e.g., [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/)) directly into the developers’ IDEs and CI/CD pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early.
4. Regularly Rotate Credentials
   * Use [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) integrated with solutions like [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for dynamic secret management and rotation. (_Kubernetes Secrets are, by default, stored unencrypted_)
5. Holistic Monitoring
   * Deploy runtime security tools (e.g., [Falco](https://falco.org/)) for real-time threat detection at the container and cluster levels.
6. Stay Current with Benchmarks & Frameworks
   * Reference security guidelines like the[ CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes) and keep track of emerging threats to update your defences accordingly.

## Conclusion

Securing only one layer is insufficient. Even the most secure code can be compromised if the underlying cluster or cloud settings are misconfigured. Conversely, a secure cloud foundation can’t compensate for vulnerable container images or poorly written code.&#x20;

Layered security is no longer optional—it is a necessity. Much like a Go board, where every stone’s placement influences the entire game, the 4Cs of Cloud Native Security require strategic foresight. Each layer (Cloud, Cluster, Container, Code) must be secured not in isolation, but as part of an interconnected defense where weaknesses in one area are compensated by strengths in others.
