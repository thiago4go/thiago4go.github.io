# About This Section

Welcome to the **Cloud Native Security** section of our blog. This series offers clear, actionable guidance to secure cloud-native systems, with a focus on Kubernetes and modern infrastructure. These posts aim to simplify complex security concepts into practical steps.

#### **What You’ll Learn**

This section breaks down cloud-native security into core components, covering:

* **Foundational Security Models**: Understand the layered approach of the 4Cs (Cloud, Cluster, Container, Code) and how they work together to protect your environment.
* **Infrastructure Hardening**: Apply best practices for identity management, network segmentation (like VPCs), and encryption across major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).
* **Compliance Frameworks**: Learn how standards like NIST, CIS, and ISO 27001 align with Kubernetes security controls to meet regulatory requirements.
* **Isolation Strategies**: Reduce risks in multi-tenant systems using Kubernetes namespaces, sandboxed runtimes (gVisor), and lightweight virtual machines (Kata Containers).
* **Secure Artifact Management**: Implement tools like Sigstore for signing, Trivy for vulnerability scanning, and Harbor for secure storage to ensure trusted software delivery.
* **Workload Protection**: Restrict container privileges, filter system calls with seccomp, and enforce runtime rules with AppArmor to minimize attack surfaces.
* **Role Clarity**: Navigate the shared responsibility model to identify what’s managed by cloud providers, DevOps teams, and developers in Kubernetes environments.

#### **Why It Matters**

Cloud-native technologies introduce unique security challenges. Misconfigurations, overly permissive access, or unpatched vulnerabilities can expose critical systems. This series aims to provide a structured path to build  an holistic understanding of cloud native security.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Each post builds on core concepts while remaining standalone for quick reference. Start with the layered 4Cs model for a big-picture view, or jump directly to topics like image scanning or workload hardening.&#x20;
