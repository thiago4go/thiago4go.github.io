# Platform Security

This section addresses security at the platform level, ensuring the infrastructure and tools supporting Kubernetes—from software supply chains to service meshes—are resilient, compliant, and trustworthy.

#### **What You’ll Learn**

A holistic approach to securing the platforms that underpin Kubernetes, covering:

* **Secure Software Delivery**: Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), enforce SLSA compliance levels, and sign artifacts with Sigstore’s Cosign. Harden image repositories (Harbor, Artifactory) with scanning, role-based access, and vulnerability blocking.
* **Visibility & Monitoring**: Centralize logs, metrics, and traces using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki to detect security anomalies and performance issues.
* **Zero-Trust Networking**: Implement service meshes like Istio for mutual TLS (mTLS), granular RBAC policies, and encrypted traffic between services.
* **Certificate Management**: Design a Kubernetes PKI hierarchy to automate certificate issuance, rotation, and revocation for cluster components.
* **Cluster Isolation**: Protect API servers with private endpoints, VPNs, and API gateways to minimize public exposure.
* **Policy Enforcement**: Use OPA Gatekeeper to validate resource configurations (e.g., pod security, resource limits) and secure Helm charts by auditing dependencies and enforcing provenance.

#### **Why It Matters**

Platform-level vulnerabilities—such as unsigned artifacts, exposed API endpoints, or misconfigured service meshes—can cascade into cluster-wide breaches. By securing the tools and processes that build, deploy, and monitor applications, you reduce risks like supply chain attacks, credential leaks, and unauthorized access.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Start with foundational practices like SBOM generation and image repository hardening, then advance to complex topics like PKI automation or service mesh policies. Posts like _Helm Chart Security_ or _Admission Control with Gatekeeper_ include actionable code snippets for immediate implementation.
