# Welcome to the Kubernetes Security playbook

Hey there, cloud-native enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹\
Iâ€™m Thiagoâ€”a **Cloud Native BizDevOps Architect**, CNCF Kubestronaut, and your guide through the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes security. If  youâ€™re just starting your cloud journey or securing mission-critical clusters and want to keep your security skills razor-sharp, youâ€™re in the right place.

#### **Why This Blog?**

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve channeled my passion into developing the [**`Kubernetes Security KCSA Mock Exam App`**](https://github.com/thiago4go/kubernetes-security-kcsa-mock), empowering thousands of professionals to prepare for certification while cultivating a security-first mindset. Now, Iâ€™m bringing that same dedication to this blog, with a focus on delivering **actionable insights** that bridge theory and practice. This isnâ€™t just another opinion hubâ€”itâ€™s a resource built on:

* **Real-World Scenarios**: Every post is addressing production incidents and aligning with modern security best practices.
* **Industry Standards**: Aligned with CNCF whitepapers, CIS Benchmarks, NIST guidelines, and MITRE ATT\&CK frameworks.
* **KCSA Exam Synergy**: Content directly maps to the examâ€™s core domains, doubling as both a practical guide and a study companion.

***

#### **Explore the Core Pillars of Kubernetes Security**

We will dive into structured, in-depth content across six critical areas:

1. **Cloud Native Security**
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Component Security**
3. **Kubernetes Security Fundamentals**
4. **Kubernetes Threat Model**
5. **Platform Security**
6. **Compliance and Security Frameworks**

***

#### This blog is for **doers**:

* **DevOps & Security Engineers**: Implement fixes for API security, runtime threats, and compliance.
* **Architects & Leaders**: Design secure clusters with zero-trust networking, SBOM-driven pipelines, and audit-ready configurations.
