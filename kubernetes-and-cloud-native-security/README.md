# Welcome to the Kubernetes Security playbook

Hey there, cloud-native enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹\
Iâ€™m Thiagoâ€”a **Cloud Native BizDevOps Architect**, CNCF Kubestronaut, and your guide through the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes security. If  youâ€™re just starting your cloud journey or securing mission-critical clusters and want to keep your security skills razor-sharp, youâ€™re in the right place.

#### **Why This Blog?**

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve poured my passion into building the [**Kubernetes Security KCSA Mock Exam App**](https://kubernetes-security-kcsa-mock.vercel.app/), helping thousands of professionals prepare for certification while embedding security-first mindsets. Now, Iâ€™m channeling that same energy into this blog to: . This blog isnâ€™t just about theory or opinionsâ€”itâ€™s about **grounded, actionable strategies** backed by:

* **Real-World Scenarios**: Every post is grounded in production incidents and modern best practices.
* **Industry Standards**: Aligned with CIS Benchmarks, NIST guidelines, and MITRE ATT\&CK frameworks.
* **KCSA Exam Synergy**: Content mirrors the examâ€™s domains, making it a perfect study companion.

#### **Explore the Core Pillars of Kubernetes Security**

We will dive into structured, in-depth content across six critical areas:

1. **Cloud Native Security**
2. **Kubernetes Cluster Component Security**
3. **Kubernetes Security Fundamentals**
