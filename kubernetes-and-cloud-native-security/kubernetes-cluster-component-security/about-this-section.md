# About This Section

This section focuses on securing the core building blocks of Kubernetes clusters. Each post dives into hardening critical components—from the API server to storage—ensuring your cluster remains resilient against attacks.

#### **What You’ll Learn**

A comprehensive guide to securing Kubernetes internals, covering:

* **Core Component Hardening**: Secure the API server with TLS certificates, RBAC policies, and audit logging. Restrict Controller Manager permissions and safeguard the scheduler from pod placement exploits.
* **Node and Runtime Security**: Disable anonymous access to Kubelet, evaluate container runtimes (containerd vs. CRI-O), and enforce seccomp profiles to limit container privileges.
* **Network Protections**: Prevent service spoofing with KubeProxy and Network Policies. Implement zero-trust rules using CNI plugins like Calico and Cilium.
* **Data and Storage Security**: Encrypt etcd secrets at rest, secure PersistentVolumes with encryption, and restrict permissions for CSI drivers.
* **Workload and Client Safety**: Configure pods to run as non-root users, drop unnecessary capabilities, and secure kubectl access with short-lived tokens and encrypted kubeconfig files.

#### **Why It Matters**

Kubernetes clusters are complex, with components that can become entry points for attackers if misconfigured. Unsecured API endpoints, overly permissive Kubelet settings, or unencrypted etcd data can lead to breaches. This series aims to provide basic strategies to protect each piece of your cluster.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Start with foundational components like the API server and Kubelet, then progress to advanced topics like CNI policies or CSI driver security. Each post includes specific commands and configurations for immediate implementation.
