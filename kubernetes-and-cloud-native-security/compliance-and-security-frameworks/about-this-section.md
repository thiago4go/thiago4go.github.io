# About This Section

**About This Section: Compliance and Security Frameworks**

This section bridges Kubernetes security with industry standards and compliance requirements. Learn how to audit clusters, align with frameworks like NIST and MITRE ATT\&CK, and automate policies to meet regulatory and organizational goals.

#### **What Youâ€™ll Learn**

A practical guide to integrating compliance into Kubernetes workflows, covering:

* **Benchmark Audits**: Implement the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark using tools like kube-bench to identify misconfigurations and automate fixes.
* **Framework Alignment**: Map Kubernetes security practices to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) for risk management.
* **Threat Intelligence**: Analyze adversary tactics (e.g., credential theft, lateral movement) using MITRE ATT\&CK and prioritize defenses.
* **Supply Chain Compliance**: Meet SLSA and SPDX standards by generating provenance, tracking dependencies, and securing build pipelines.
* **Policy Automation**: Enforce compliance-as-code with tools like Kyverno and Checkov to validate resources, RBAC, and images in CI/CD pipelines.

#### **Why It Matters**

Regulatory requirements and audit readiness are critical for organizations running Kubernetes in production. Unaddressed compliance gaps can lead to fines, breaches, or loss of customer trust. This series translates abstract standards into actionable steps, helping you build audit-proof clusters while mitigating risks like credential theft or supply chain attacks.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Start with foundational audits using the CIS Benchmark, then align your strategy with frameworks like NIST or MITRE ATT\&CK. Posts like _Automating Compliance_ or _Supply Chain Compliance_ provide code snippets and workflows to embed compliance into development pipelines.
