# Kubernetes Security Fundamentals

This section tackles essential security practices for Kubernetes, from authentication to runtime protection. Learn how to enforce policies, manage secrets, and monitor threats to build a robust security foundation for your clusters.

#### **What Youâ€™ll Learn**

A structured exploration of Kubernetes security essentials, covering:

* **Policy Enforcement**: Implement Pod Security Standards (Baseline/Restricted) via Admission Controllers and migrate legacy PodSecurityPolicies to modern Pod Security Admission (PSA).
* **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access with X.509 certificates, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and least-privilege RBAC roles. Audit permissions and automate role checks.
* **Secrets Management**: Replace insecure Kubernetes Secrets with HashiCorp Vault and Secrets Store CSI Driver for encrypted, dynamic secret handling.
* **Network Segmentation**: Apply zero-trust principles using Network Policies to block lateral movement and control east-west traffic.
* **Threat Detection**: Monitor API activity with audit logging, detect runtime anomalies using Falco and eBPF, and alert on high-risk operations.
* **Admission Control**: Extend policy enforcement with Validating/Mutating Webhooks (e.g., resource limits, image signing) and custom logic via Open Policy Agent (OPA).
* **DNS Security**: Harden CoreDNS configurations to prevent data exfiltration and log DNS queries for threat analysis.

#### **Why It Matters**

Kubernetes defaults often prioritize flexibility over security. Unrestricted pods, static secrets, or permissive network rules can expose clusters to compromise. This series addresses these gaps, providing actionable steps to enforce least privilege, encrypt sensitive data, and detect malicious activity.

#### **How to Use This Series**

Begin with foundational topics like Pod Security Standards or RBAC, then progress to advanced tools like Vault or Falco. Posts like _Migrating from PodSecurityPolicies to Pod Security Admission_ or _Dynamic Admission Control_ include migration guides and code snippets for seamless implementation.
